# Andy Park

Hi, my name is Andy. I'm a software developer living and working in Tokyo, Japan. 
I have been building and working on web applications since 2007.
I have experience with many different technologies, but my main focus has been front-end development.

I am currently trying out a new programming language each month:
1. January:  [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
2. February: [Java](https://www.java.com/)
3. March:    [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
4. April:    [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
5. May:      [Go](https://go.dev/)
6. June:     [Haxe](https://haxe.org/)
7. July:     TBD
8. August:   TBD
