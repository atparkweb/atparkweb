# Andy Park

Hi, my name is Andy. I'm a software engineer and tech educator working for [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/). I have been building and working on web applications since 2007. I have experience developing with many different technologies, but my main focus has been on front-end development with JavaScript.

I'm not opinionated about tech, but I like working with:
- Elixir
- GraphQL
- React
- Typescript
- Python

## Toolbox
- Emacs (Spacemacs Evil Mode)
- Visual Studio Code
