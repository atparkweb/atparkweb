# Andy Park

Hi, my name is Andy. I'm a software engineer and tech educator working for [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/). I have been building and working on web applications since 2007. I have experience with many different technologies, but my main focus has been front-end development.

I enjoy working with the following:
- Elixir
- Jupyter
- Lisps
- Python
- Typescript
