# Andy Park

Hi, my name is Andy. I'm a software developer living and working in Tokyo, Japan. 
I have been building and working on web applications since 2007.
I have experience with many different technologies, but my main focus has been front-end development.

I enjoy working with the following:
- Elixir
- Lisp
- Python
- Typescript

Currently trying out a new programming language each month:

1. Jan: [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
2. Feb: [Java](https://www.java.com/)
3. Mar: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
4. Apr: [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
5. May: TBD
