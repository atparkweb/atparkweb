# Andy Park

Hi, my name is Andy. I'm a software engineer and tech educator working for [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/). I have been building and working on web applications since 2007. I have experience developing with many different technologies, but my main focus has been on front-end development with JavaScript.

I'm not very opinionated about technology, but I enjoy working with the following:
- Elixir
- Typescript
- Python
- Lisps
- Emacs
